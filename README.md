# Build a Coin-Flip Game with ETH tokens as bet.

### Create a website, hosted on Vercel, that does the following:
- Pick a blockchain from: Ethereum, Solana or Bitcoin. Use their 'devnet/testnet'.
- Build a coinflip game, where the user can connect their wallet and then flip a coin on their screen.
- User can select how much token (ETH, SOL or BTC) they want to risk, and also select a side.
- If it lands on the side they have choosen, they get double their tokens back, if it's the wrong side, they get nothing.
- Make the UI/UX design nice.
- You should test the side before submitting, and it should work. I should be able to test and it should give me tokens back.
